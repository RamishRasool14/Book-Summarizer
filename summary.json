        "summary": "Raskolnikov, a young man living in poverty and fear, pawns a watch to his landlady, Alyona Ivanovna, and then goes to a tavern to drink beer and clear his mind. He encounters a group of drunk men and a retired government clerk at the tavern. Throughout the chapter, Raskolnikov is plagued by inner turmoil and a sense of loathing. He wakes up feeling irritable and ill-tempered in his small, run-down room. He receives a letter from his mother, Pulcheria Raskolnikov, informing him that his sister, Dounia, is engaged to a man named Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. Raskolnikov is initially emotional, but then becomes angry and leaves the house in a state of turmoil.\n\nRaskolnikov is tormented by his mother's letter, which reveals his sister's engagement to a man he despises. He is consumed by bitterness and anger, and his thoughts turn to a young girl he sees on the street who appears to be drunk and in distress. He becomes involved in trying to help her, but ultimately feels wretched and confused about his own actions and motivations. He also reflects on his strained relationship with his friend Razumihin. He is contemplating going to Razumihin for help, but is unsure if it will be of any use. He wanders through the city, feeling feverish and exhausted, and has a disturbing dream about a horse being beaten to death. He then has a moment of clarity and renounces his dark thoughts. He encounters Lizaveta, the sister of the pawnbroker he plans to rob, and learns that she will be alone the next day. This solidifies his decision to carry out his plan.\n\nRaskolnikov discovers that Lizaveta, the huckster's sister, is a kind and hardworking woman who is mistreated by her sister. He also overhears a conversation about the old pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, and becomes fixated on the idea of committing a crime. He plans to steal an axe and goes to the old woman's apartment, but hesitates when he hears someone inside. After ringing the bell, he hears someone listening at the door and realizes he has been discovered. He visits the old woman's apartment and attempts to distract her while he steals from her. He ends up killing her and her sister, and narrowly avoids being caught by other visitors to the apartment. He manages to return the murder weapon to its hiding place and retreat to his room, where he is overwhelmed by the events and unable to think clearly.\n\nRaskolnikov wakes up in a dazed state and realizes he may have committed a crime. He frantically tries to hide evidence and is summoned to the police station. At the station, he experiences a sudden and intense feeling of isolation and indifference, and then faints.

They discuss a murder case involving a house-painter named Nikolay, who is accused of killing two women and stealing their jewelry.

The visit ends with Luzhin leaving in a huff, and Raskolnikov expressing his desire to be left alone. Raskolnikov, in a state of calm and determination, leaves his apartment and goes out into the street. He encounters various people and experiences a range of emotions, from apathy to disgust. He ends up at the scene of a crime and is eventually thrown out by a porter. He contemplates going to the police station but ultimately decides against it. Raskolnikov encounters a crowd gathered around a man who has been run over by a carriage. He recognizes the injured man as Marmeladov, a retired government clerk, and insists on taking him to his home for medical attention. Meanwhile, Katerina Ivanovna, Marmeladov's wife, is dealing with her own struggles at home, including caring for her sick children and dealing with financial hardships. Raskolnikov eventually brings Marmeladov home, but later faints upon seeing his mother and sister, who had been waiting for him. Razumihin, a friend, assures them that Raskolnikov is fine and helps him recover.\n\nRaskolnikov is seen in a state of emotional distress, with his family and friends trying to console him.
