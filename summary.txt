The novel "Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky follows the story of the main character, Raskolnikov, a young man living in poverty and isolation. Raskolnikov is in a state of mental and physical distress and is contemplating a plan that he is hesitant and fearful about. He visits a pawnbroker to pawn a watch, and the interaction with the pawnbroker leaves him feeling repulsed and agitated. He then goes to a tavern, where he meets a retired clerk named Marmeladov, who is drunk and begins to tell Raskolnikov about his life. Marmeladov talks about his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, and their difficult living situation, including their poverty and the struggles they face. He also mentions his daughter, Sonia, who is forced to work as a prostitute to support the family. Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother informing him of his sister's engagement to a man named Mr. Luzhin. Raskolnikov is furious at the news and feels that his family is making a mistake by agreeing to the marriage. He reflects on his sister's sacrifice and the potential consequences of her decision. As he walks through the city, he encounters a drunken young girl and becomes involved in a confrontation with a dandy who seems to be following her. Raskolnikov is struggling with his inner turmoil and contemplating his next steps. He is filled with anxiety and uncertainty about his future, and he is haunted by a disturbing dream. He eventually falls asleep and has a vivid and horrifying dream about a horse being brutally beaten to death. This dream deeply affects him and causes him to question his own morality and sanity. Raskolnikov learns about the background of the huckster and his wife's invitation to Lizaveta. He becomes superstitious and starts to see strange and mysterious coincidences. He recalls a conversation he overheard about the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta, and becomes fixated on the idea of committing a crime. He then goes through a series of preparations, including making a noose and securing an axe, before finally ringing the doorbell of the old woman's apartment. Raskolnikov goes to the old woman's apartment to pawn a pledge, but ends up murdering her with an axe. He also kills her sister, Lizaveta, when she unexpectedly arrives. After the murders, he frantically searches for valuables in the apartment and narrowly avoids being caught by two visitors. He manages to escape and returns to his room in a state of shock and confusion. Raskolnikov wakes up in a daze and realizes that it is past two o'clock in the morning. He suddenly remembers everything that happened the previous night and is filled with fear and despair. He frantically searches his clothes for any evidence of his actions and hides the items he took from the old woman's house. He is overcome with shivering and exhaustion, and when he is summoned to the police office, he is unable to think clearly. At the office, he experiences a sudden revulsion and indifference towards the people around him, feeling a sense of agonizing solitude and remoteness. Despite feeling ill, he is questioned by the police and struggles to maintain his composure. He eventually leaves the office, feeling a renewed sense of terror and suspicion. Raskolnikov frantically searches his room for the stolen items, finding them hidden in a hole in the wall. He quickly leaves his room, fearing pursuit, and decides to dispose of the stolen items in the canal. However, he changes his mind and decides to hide them in a deserted courtyard. He then goes to visit his friend Razumihin, who notices that Raskolnikov is ill. Raskolnikov abruptly leaves, but later returns to accept a job translating a German article. He then experiences a moment of intense repulsion and alienation from the world around him. As he walks home, he is startled by a scream and realizes that his landlady is being beaten by Ilya Petrovitch. However, Nastasya, the servant, tells him that no one has been beating the landlady and that the blood he heard was just in his ears. He then loses consciousness.

Raskolnikov is recovering from his illness and is visited by a young man with a beard who brings him a remittance from his mother. Raskolnikov is reluctant to accept the money and is agitated and confused. Razumihin also visits him and brings him new clothes, trying to cheer him up. Raskolnikov struggles to remember recent events and eventually falls asleep. When he wakes up, Razumihin is there with new clothes for him. Raskolnikov continues to struggle with his disorientation and memory loss, but Razumihin continues to support and care for him. Raskolnikov eventually falls asleep again, and when he wakes up, Razumihin is once again there with new clothes for him. This pattern continues as Raskolnikov battles with his illness and confusion, and Razumihin remains a constant source of support and care for him.

Raskolnikov, the protagonist of "Crime and Punishment," is visited by various characters, including his friend Razumihin, a doctor named Zossimov, and a man named Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. Raskolnikov's interactions with these characters reveal his inner turmoil and the suspicions surrounding him in connection to a murder case.

Porfiry Petrovitch visits Raskolnikov and tries to convince him to confess to the murders. Raskolnikov remains defiant and refuses to admit to anything. Raskolnikov is feeling anxious and exhausted as he hurries to meet Svidrigaïlov, a man who seems to have some hidden power over him. He is worried about Svidrigaïlov's potential influence on his future and his sister, Dounia. When he finally meets Svidrigaïlov at a tavern, they engage in a conversation where Svidrigaïlov reveals his past as a card-sharper and his views on vice. Raskolnikov becomes increasingly uncomfortable and eventually leaves, feeling convinced that Svidrigaïlov is a worthless scoundrel.

Raskolnikov confronts Svidrigaïlov about his intentions towards his sister, and the two engage in a tense conversation. Svidrigaïlov tries to convince Raskolnikov to let him see his sister, but Raskolnikov remains suspicious. Svidrigaïlov then reveals to Raskolnikov that he has been listening in on conversations between him and Sofya Semyonovna, and tries to manipulate Raskolnikov into leaving the country. Meanwhile, Dounia meets with Svidrigaïlov and he tries to convince her to save her brother by offering to take him abroad. Dounia, feeling threatened, pulls out a revolver and threatens Svidrigaïlov, but ultimately does not shoot him. Svidrigaïlov, feeling defeated, lets Dounia leave and is left alone in despair.

Svidrigaïlov spends the evening going from one low haunt to another, treating people to drinks and entertainment. He ends up in a pleasure garden, where he pays for the entrance and gets involved in a dispute between clerks. He then goes to visit Sonia, giving her money and making arrangements for her and her family.
